caption: Restricts accounts that can use the <ph name="MICROSOFT_ONE_DRIVE_NAME">Microsoft OneDrive</ph> integration
default: null
desc: |-
  This policy allows admins to restrict which accounts are allowed to sign-in for <ph name="MICROSOFT_ONE_DRIVE_NAME">Microsoft OneDrive</ph> when the <ph name="MICROSOFT_ONE_DRIVE_MOUNT_POLICY_NAME">MicrosoftOneDriveMount</ph> is enabled.

  If this policy is unset or set to an empty value, any account can be used to sign-in.

  If this policy is set to a domain name or tenant ID (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols#endpoints), only accounts from that domain name or tenant ID can be used to sign-in.

  Changing the restriction might lead to users being signed out of their <ph name="MICROSOFT_ONE_DRIVE_NAME">Microsoft OneDrive</ph> account if it does not adhere to the new restriction.
