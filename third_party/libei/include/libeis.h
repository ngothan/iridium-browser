/**
 * @addtogroup libeis EIS - The server API
 *
 * libeis is the server-side module. This API should be used by processes
 * that have control over input devices, e.g. Wayland compositors.
 *
 * libei clients come in "sender" and "receiver" modes, depending on whether
 * the client sends or receives events. A libeis context however may accept
 * both sender and receiver clients, the EIS implementation works as
 * corresponding receiver or sender for this client. It is up to the
 * implementation to disconnect clients that it does not want to allow. See
 * eis_client_is_sender() for details.
 *
 * Note that usually the differentiation between sender and receiver client
 * has an effect on the devices that should be sent to the client. Sender
 * clients typically expect devices representing the available screen area so
 * they can control input, receiver clients typically expect devices
 * representing the physical input devices.

 * @struct eis_region
 *
 * Regions are only available on devices of type @ref EIS_DEVICE_TYPE_VIRTUAL.
 *
 * A rectangular region, defined by an x/y offset and a width and a height.
 * A region defines the area on an EIS desktop layout that is accessible by
 * this device - this region may not be the full area of the desktop.
 * Input events may only be sent for points within the regions.
 *
 * The use of regions is private to the EIS compositor and coordinates do not
 * need match the size of the actual desktop. For example, a compositor may
 * set a 1920x1080 region to represent a 4K monitor and transparently map
 * input events into the respective true pixels.
 *
 * Absolute devices may have different regions, it is up to the libei client
 * to send events through the correct device to target the right pixel. For
 * example, a dual-head setup my have two absolute devices, the first with a
 * zero offset region spanning the first screen, the second with a nonzero
 * offset spanning the second screen.
 *
 * Regions should not overlap, no behavior for overlapping regions has yet
 * been defined but this may change in the future.
 *
 * Regions must be assigned when the device is created and are static for the
 * lifetime of the device. See eis_device_new_region() and eis_region_add().
