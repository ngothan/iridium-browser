 * by the EIS implementation.
 *
 * In some use-cases though, relative data from a remote input source needs
 * to be converted by the libei client into an absolute movement on an EIS
 * region. In that case, the physical scale provides the factor to multiply
 * the relative logical input to provide the expected physical relative
 * movement.
 *
 * For example consider the following dual-monitor setup comprising a 2k and
 * a 4k monitor **of the same physical size**:
 * The physical layout of the monitors appears like this:
 * @code
 *        2k            4k
 *  +-------------++-------------+
 *  |             ||             |
 *  |  a   b      ||   c   d     |
 *  |             ||             |
 *  +-------------++-------------+
 * @endcode
 *
 * The physical distance `ab` is the same as the physical distance `cd`.
 * Where the EIS implementation supports high-dpi screens, the logical
 * distance (in pixels) are identical too.
 *
 * Where the EIS implementation does not support high-dpi screens, the
 * logical layout of these two monitors appears like this:
 *
 * @code
 *        2k            4k
 *  +-------------++--------------------------+
 *  |             ||                          |
 *  |  a   b      ||                          |
 *  |             ||                          |
 *  +-------------+|     c       d            |
 *                 |                          |
 *                 |                          |
 *                 |                          |
 *                 +--------------------------+
 * @endcode
 *
 * While the two physical distances `ab` and `cd` are still identical, the
 * logical distance `cd` (in pixels) is twice that of `ab`.
 * Where a libei client receives relative deltas from an input source and
 * converts that relative input into an absolute position on the screen, it
 * needs to take this into account.
 *
 * For example, if a remote input source moves by relative 100 logical
 * pixels, the libei client would convert this as `a + 100 = b` on the
 * region for the 2k screen and send the absolute events to logically change
 * the position from `a` to `b`. If the same remote input source moves by
 * relative 100 logical pixels, the libei client would convert this as
 * `c + 100 * scale = d` on the region for the 4k screen to logically
 * change the position from `c` to `d`. While the pixel movement differs,
 * the physical movement as seen by the user is thus identical.
 *
 * A second possible use-case for the physical scale is to match pixels from
 * one region to their respective counterpart on a different region.
 * For example, if the bottom-right corner of the 2k screen in the
 * illustration above has a coordinate of ``(x, y)``, the neighbouring pixel on
 * the **physical** 4k screen is ``(0, y * scale)``.
